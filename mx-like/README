This is a set of widgets written in QML to mimic the Moblin user eXperience (MX widgets).

The QML examples in the examples directory require the MX qml module to be built and installed. To do this, execute

qmake
make
make install

from this directory. You will need to use Qt 4.7 (use the qmake from a 4.7 build) from qt.gitorious.org. The 4.7 technical preview is too old, but the upcoming beta should be new enough.
