This source tree contains the Qt Components project.

Building
========
qmake (for compiling specific component sets add '-config mx' and/or '-config meego')
make
make install

The project is divided into:

- The library libQtCompoenents: contain general purpose helpers for C++;
- The module Qt.labs.components: _for now_ contains general purpose helpers for QML.

and also (for the time being) two QML modules for component sets implemented using those components

- com.meego: components from MeeGo Touch UI library;
- Qt.labs.Mx: set of UI components inspired in the Mx toolkit.

The lib will install in QTDIR/lib, while the modules will go to QTDIR/imports.

Build dependencies
==================
- Qt 4.7

Optional dependencies
=====================
- MeeGo Touch (for the com.meego module)
  -- download and install: libmeegotouch & meegotouch-theme from http://meego.gitorious.org/meegotouch

Running on Desktop
==================
- Pass -graphicssystem native




Build instructions for MeeGoTouch (quickstart)
==============================================
(After trying to install things in a different prefix,
 I gave up since I couldn't get meegotouch to find its theme.)

You will need these projects:
git://gitorious.org/meegotouch/meegotouch-theme.git
git://gitorious.org/meegotouch/libmeegotouch.git
git@gitorious.org:qt-components/qt-components.git

1: theme: qmake && make install
     copy /usr/share/theme to /usr/local/share/theme

2: libmeegotouch: ./configure && make install

# mmoc is required
export PATH=/usr/local/bin/:$PATH
4: qt-components: qmake -config meego -r && make install
     (installs into your current binary qt path)

On destop: -graphicssystem native needed:
5: run example: cd qt-components/examples/meego/calculator && ./calculator -graphicssystem native
