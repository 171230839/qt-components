This source tree contains the Qt Components project.

Building
========
qmake (for compiling specific component sets add '-config mx' and/or '-config meego')
make
make install

The project is divided into:

- The library libQtCompoenents: contain general purpose helpers for C++;
- The module Qt.labs.components: _for now_ contains general purpose helpers for QML.

and also (for the time being) two QML modules for component sets implemented using those components

- com.meego: components from MeeGo Touch UI library;
- Qt.labs.Mx: set of UI components inspired in the Mx toolkit.

The lib will install in QTDIR/lib, while the modules will go to QTDIR/imports.
