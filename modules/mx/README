This plugin contains the native code needed to implement Mx like behaviour. It no longer needs the private headers, since the required functionality has now been integrated into Qt.

The Mx widgets now depend on the rest of the qt-components project. Make sure you have built the components library, as errors finding QML Types can be the result of not properly loading the plugin or a library it depends on.
